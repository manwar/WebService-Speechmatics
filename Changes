Revision history for Perl module WebService::Speechmatics

    - Removed a debugging print statement.
    - The `lang` attribute was required on the constructor, but as noted
      in the doc it shouldn't be. You can specify the lang when submitting
      a job, and if you've done neither, then it will croak.
      Thanks to José Joaquín Atria for pointing this out.
    - Fixed typo in the doc.
